
# Spring Boot- APIRest

This is an example of a REST API developed using the Spring Boot Framework, Maven, and JPA-Hibernate for data persistence, connected to a MySQL database. Additionally, this project has been deployed using Docker for container management. To perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on a sample entity, such as Product, users are required to log in with existing credentials or create a new user.


## Starting the Project
To build and package the project, you can execute the following commando

```
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```
This command will clean the project, compile the code, run tests (skipped with -DskipTests), and package the application into a JAR file.


## Docker Container 
Navigate to the docker directory:

```
cd docker
```

To start the Docker container, use the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```
This command will initialize the Docker container based on the configuration provided in the docker-compose.yml file.

To take down the Docker container when finished testing, you can use the following command:

```
docker-compose down
```
